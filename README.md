# project2025_template

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxx.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxx)

## Overview

This repository serves as a **template** for simulation projects developed in the MA course  
**“Agent-based Modelling for Archaeologists: From Concept to Application and Publication.”**

It provides a recommended folder structure and documentation style to ensure that every project is:
- Reproducible  
- Transparent  
- Citable  
- Easy to understand and extend

Replace this text with a short description of your own project once you fork the repository.

## Repository structure

| Folder | Contents | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `model/` | NetLogo model files (`.nlogo`) | Implementation of your simulation |
| `data/` | Input datasets (e.g., environment, agents) | Empirical or synthetic data |
| `results/` | Simulation outputs | Results from experiments or BehaviorSpace runs |
| `analysis/` | R scripts and outputs | Data preparation, analysis and visualisation |
| `docs/` | Notes and references | Conceptual documentation, figures, and citations |

---

## Getting started

### Option 1 – Work fully online

You can edit files directly in your browser:
1. Click “Use this template” → “Create a new repository.”
2. Name it `project2025_<model-name>`.
3. Edit files by clicking “Add file → Create new file” or the ✏️ icon.

### Option 2 – Clone locally (if you have Git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoDArchLab-ABM/project2025_<model-name>.git
```

Then edit, commit, and push as usual.

---

## Recommended next steps

1. Fill in your project’s conceptual model in `docs/notes.md`.
2. Add a draft NetLogo file in `model/`.
3. Add placeholder data (if relevant) in `data/`.
4. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
5. Publish your first release (`v0.1`) and connect Zenodo to obtain a DOI.
